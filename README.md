  ## About The Project
The machine learning aspect involves enabling the app to recognize Balinese Dance via image scans from the camera. To facilitate object detection, we plan to use pretrained models like YOLO or Faster R-CNN, TensorFlow for neural networks, OpenCV for image preprocessing, NumPy for data manipulation, and scikit-learn for model evaluation.

Libraries Requirement:
1. TensorFlow (Deep learning framework for building neural networks.)
2. tfjs (For running machine learning models directly in web browsers)
3. OpenCV (For preprocessing image data.)
4. Keras (High-level neural networks API commonly paired with TensorFlow for simplified model development.)
5. NumPy (For data manipulation and numerical operations.)
6. scikit-learn (For data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation.)
7. Matplotlib (For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.)
8. Seaborn (Library for visualizing data.)
