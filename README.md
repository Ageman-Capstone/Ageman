  ## About The Project
This project built a CNN model in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shubhamparmar1/License-Plate-Detection-using-Deep-Learning/.config/colab1.png" alt="Google Colab" width = 90px></a>. and we ensured at least 250 data points per label and preprocessed datasets which included displaying data distribution (90% for training, 5% for validation, and 5% for testing), showcasing some data examples, and conducting data augmentation.. After training on TensorFlow and Keras, the model was saved (.h5) and converted (JSON) for mobile app integration.
